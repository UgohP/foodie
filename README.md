  <h2 align="center">Foodie - Restaurant Website</h2>

Foodie is a fully responsive restaurant website. It is designed to work seamlessly across all devices and was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was then adapted into **EJS** for dynamic rendering and integrated with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** for the backend.

**Special thanks to the original creators whose frontend templates were used as the foundation for this project:**

- **Grilli Restaurant Website** by [CodeWithSadee](https://github.com/codewithsadee/grilli) (used as inspiration for the main website layout).
